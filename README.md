# C Functions â€“ Strings, Pointers & Arrays

This repo contains small C programs that focus on **functions** with a main emphasis on:

- String manipulation  
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic  
- Arrays (1D & basic 2D usage)  

Most examples avoid brute-force methods and use **pointer-based solutions**.

## Topics Covered

- Basics of declaring and calling functions
- Passing parameters: by value and by reference
- Passing arrays and strings to functions
- String manipulation using pointers
- Removing / replacing / modifying characters
- Custom implementations of common string functions

## How to Run

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
